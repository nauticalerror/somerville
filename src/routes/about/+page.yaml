hed: welcome to somerville (hi)
about: >
  somerville is a very real city in ma, usa. it is also a real city in a world where ma and usa do not exist. 


  in this somerville, there is only glorious decay. there is only a fresh pond which is neither fresh nor a pond anymore, only a still, unbroken, rust-red surface.
